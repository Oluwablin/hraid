      <h1> Task Description</h1>
       <p> 
         The first thing you have to do is to make the execution asynchronous in PHP. To acheive this, you can follow this steps.
         1. Leverage on Queues (Amazon SQS to handle each task).

         2. Make use of Parallel processing to handle the API operation and Database operation at both time(like spatie/async). 

         3. To handle the Queues, there will have to be like about 100 background workers to handle the jobs.

         4. For Parallel Processing, you can get the two operations to happen in the same 1.6secs since both would occur simultaneously.

      <p>
          Then, in order to achieve such operation of 100,000 users in 4.5 hours, one will have to go higher and tackle the hardware layer by introducing multiple instances and queues. If 10,000users would take an hour, 100,000 users would take 10hours mathematically, so to get half the time execution, it would cost more hardware layer definitely.
